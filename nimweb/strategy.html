		<h3>Mathematical Principals</h3>
		<p>
			<span class="p-begin">T</span>o understand Nim (and to ensure you win
			every time), you should have a fundamental understanding of the
			binary numbering system. Binary is a base-2 numbering system. It can
			be described as on (1) and off (0). A binary number uses a radix
			(number of unique digits) of 2. To write a number in binary, you must
			know the value of the position within the binary number. Take a look
			at the table below.
		</p>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>Binary</th>
				<td>10000000<sub>2</sub></td>
				<td>1000000<sub>2</sub></td>
				<td>100000<sub>2</sub></td>
				<td>10000<sub>2</sub></td>
				<td>1000<sub>2</sub></td>
				<td>100<sub>2</sub></td>
				<td>10<sub>2</sub></td>
				<td>1<sub>2</sub></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>Decimal</th>
				<td>128</td>
				<td>64</td>
				<td>32</td>
				<td>16</td>
				<td>8</td>
				<td>4</td>
				<td>2</td>
				<td>1</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>
			Each position in a binary number increments by double of the previous
			position. In other words, reading from right to left, the first
			position of a binary number is 1. The second is 2. The third is 4,
			and so on. To show you are writing a number in binary, you should add
			a subscripted "2" to the number. For example, to write the decimal
			number 10 in binary, you would write 1010<sub>2</sub>. This is the
			equivalent of writing 8 + 2 in decimal. The first position, 1, is 0
			(off), so is not added. The second position, 2, is 1 (on), so is
			added. The third position, 4, is 0 (off), so is not added. The fourth
			position, 8, is 1 (on), so is added.
		</p>
		<p>Going back to Dr. Bouton from Harvard, he determined the
			following for Nim:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fact 1:</span> If the
				indicator of the current game position consists of all 0's, then any
				move will result in an indicator value which does not consist of all
				0's.</li>
			<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fact 2:</span> If the
				indicator of the current game position does not consist of all 0's,
				then one can remove a number of stones from one of the piles so that
				the new position obtained will have an indicator consisting of all
				0's.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Suppose we have three piles of stones of size 37, 20, and 29.
			We first compute the binary representation for each of these numbers:</p>
		<div align="CENTER">
			37 = 1 0 0 1 0 1<br /> 20 = 0 1 0 1 0 0<br /> 29 = 0 1 1 1 0 1
		</div>
		<p>Adding the columns of these binary numbers without carries
			gives:</p>
		<div align="CENTER">1 0 1 1 0 0</div>
		<p>
			This binary string is the indicator value of the position. It does
			not consist of all zeros, and, thus, the first player has a winning
			position. The question is, what move or moves can the first player
			make to achieve the win? To answer this question we proceed as
			follows:<br /> <br /> Locate the leftmost position with a 1 in the
			indicator value's binary string, and find a pile which has a 1 in
			this position of its binary representation (such a pile exists
			because there are no carries in nim-addition). In this case there is
			only one choice, the pile with 37 stones. Next we add (without
			carries) the binary representations of the other piles:
		</p>
		<div align="CENTER">
			0 1 0 1 0 0<br /> 0 1 1 1 0 1
		</div>
		<p>to get:</p>
		<div align="CENTER">0 0 1 0 0 1.</div>
		<p>The result is the string 0 0 1 0 0 1 which represents the
			number 9. Thus, if the first pile had exactly 9 stones, the new
			indicator would consist of all 0's. So we remove 37 - 9 = 28 stones
			from the first pile. By doing this, we are left with piles of stones
			of size 9, 20, and 29. When we write these numbers in binary we know
			that the addition of 20 and 29 gives the indicator string above
			(001001) which is 9, so when we add the binary string for 9 to the
			indicator string for the sum of 20 and 29 we must get a string with
			all 0's! The first player, "A" has given player "B" a position with
			an indicator string of all 0's to move from. By Fact 1, any move "B"
			makes results in an indicator string which is not all 0's and by
			repeating the process just used above, "A" has a move that will again
			give "B" a string with all 0's. "A" can win the game.</p>
