		<h3>History</h3>
		<p>
			<span class="p-begin">N</span>im has a colorful and storied history.
			While there is no definite timeline as to when Nim was created, there
			are indications that a game similar to Nim called <span>捡石子</span>
			(jiǎn-shízi), or <span>"picking stones"</span> was played in ancient
			China.

		<p>European references to a game like Nim began to appear in the
			16th century. The game was played with stones, marbles, sticks, or
			anything players had available.</p>

			1901, Dr. Bouton developed the theory of Nim that is still in use
			today.
