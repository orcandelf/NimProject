				<h3>Playing The Game</h3>
		<p>
			<span class="p-begin">T</span>hat's great," you say. "But what about
			actually playing the game?"
		</p>
		<p>I did say we were going to play, didn't I?</p>
		<p>
		This version of Nim is quite simple. There are two players - a human (you, the player)
		and a simple computer. The Nim pile starts with 7 sticks. The human player can take
		up to 3 sticks from the pile per turn. The simple computer can take only one stick from the pile
		per turn.
		</p>
		<p>When the game starts, neither the human or computer are allowed to play yet. You (the human) must
		decide which player goes first.

		When it's the human's turn, choose the number of sticks the human takes from the pile (1 to 3) and
		select "Take Sticks".
		When it's the computer's turn, select "Take Turn". One stick will be removed from the pile.
		Play continues until there is one stick left. The player that leaves the last stick in the pile WINS the game!
